# Assault Cube Trainer

Just some playing around with Assault Cube as I learn some memory read/write basics in my free time, and a bit of C#. The solution is a completely external and uses GDI to draw onto an overlay.

## Built With

* C# (though some cpp methods imported for memory reading ease)
* GDI for drawing graphics
* ESP Line only at this time, looking to add aimbot and more in my free time.
